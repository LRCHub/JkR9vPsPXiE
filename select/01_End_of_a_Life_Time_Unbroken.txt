stiff shoulders and cracking bones.
leave me to dry in the sun. I don't want to be alone.
but I cannot move. my body has know become frail.
why does it have to be this way.
I'm sick. I'm diseased. I'm dying. I'm dead.
my life once so meaningful and long.
has now turnedshort into these few remaining days.
memories of a lifetime fill my mind.
as I close my eyes one lat time.
I'm sick. I'm diseased. I'm dying. I'm dead.
not so old but I don't forget.
I'm afraid to die. but I'm not dead yet.
please kiss me one last time.
this is the end of my life.
