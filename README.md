[00:03.24] We'd run
[00:05.85] Right through
[00:08.50] Those nights
[00:10.07] I'll never find my way back to you inside this labyrinth of lights
[00:14.04] There was madness
[00:15.36] In the meaning
[00:16.81] Never laughless
[00:17.96] We were screaming at the top of our lungs to the numbness
[00:21.12] This city never died
[00:24.41] I'll fly
[00:27.09] No proof
[00:29.91] Those heights
[00:31.19] I'll never find another chance to say
[00:33.37] "Hey, thanks for saving my life"
[00:35.41] I was hopeless
[00:36.53] It was stinging
[00:37.98] Running roadless
[00:39.13] We were singing at the top of our lungs to the numbness
[00:42.50] This city never died
[00:52.50] 
[00:46.47] What was the root of it all?
[00:48.30] I couldn't say
[00:49.41] Used to jump and then fall
[00:50.86] Rugged and clichéd
[00:51.84] Would shrug it off without complaint, not a sound
[00:54.10] No use in trying to find friends 'cause in the end, nobody sticks around
[00:57.34] It's when you shoved yourself into a crowded place
[00:59.43] That you turned around and found yourself in love in outer space
[01:02.02] Cue the reckless nights, no strings
[01:03.77] Laughing at our own dreams
[01:06.06] Just what the hell was so funny?
[01:07.38] Bark up the wrong tree, stumble, used to falling great heights
[01:09.93] Amidst a concrete jungle, singing 'cause it felt right
[01:12.63] We mixed the ennui and troubles, rhyming our discontent
[01:15.31] And though it's history, I can't forget the time that we spent
[01:17.91] Convinced that this could mean another end
[01:19.70] Exists between real and pretend
[01:21.01] A twisted alter-fiction where I missed my chance, did not ascend, and
[01:23.83] Disappearing into the mist of never happened
[01:26.08] Is the me that I can never befriend
[01:28.38] I let it go
[01:30.11] Fade in, fade out
[01:32.76] This crazy dream
[01:35.41] Without a direction, floating aimlessly
[01:40.74] There's nothing left
[01:43.43] Back there for me
[01:46.12] Breathe in, but it won't stop the rain from pouring
[01:49.92] We'd run
[01:52.56] Right through
[01:55.17] Those nights
[01:56.64] I'll never find my way back to you inside this labyrinth of lights
[02:00.53] There was madness
[02:01.98] In the meaning
[02:03.26] Never laughless
[02:04.53] We were screaming at the top of our lungs to the numbness
[02:07.74] This city never died
[02:09.96] But was there ever a soul inside?
[02:11.88] Chasing fireflies between the soaring high-rises
[02:14.61] Left a trail behind, defined it, wasted time of our lives
[02:17.34] Silent singer, overworked and underpaid
[02:19.35] Thinks an office is a coffin until off is where you're laid
[02:22.25] Yet a thought persists, an optimist who ought to be afraid
[02:24.73] Saw the nothing wrong in writing songs behind the lonely shade
[02:27.46] Is the world a sadder place without the words that you conveyed
[02:30.06] When the ladder fell and shattered every bar that we had played?
[02:32.70] Does it matter in the end the sound diminished and decayed
[02:35.39] And your friends grew tired of fantasy, you're wishing they had stayed?
[02:38.03] You don't get to say, "I miss you"
[02:39.52] You watched your heroes fade
[02:40.71] Into the rear-view mirror of the villain you portrayed
[02:43.36] Stop the pity party, listen, you don't get to be dismayed
[02:46.04] You don't get to be emotional, feel blessed you got it made
[02:48.69] These the best of years of life because you chose to make a trade
[02:51.46] Recollect the days you hoped and you prayed for this
[02:53.71] What is there to miss?
[02:55.25] Fade in, fade out
[02:58.02] This hazy dream
[03:00.67] Without a direction, roaming aimlessly
[03:06.13] There's nothing left
[03:08.61] Back there for me
[03:11.34] Pretend it's the end of a made-up story
[03:15.26] I'll fly
[03:17.69] No proof
[03:20.55] Those heights
[03:21.87] I'll never find another chance to say
[03:23.88] "Hey, thanks for saving my life"
[03:25.88] I was hopeless
[03:27.29] It was stinging
[03:28.61] Driving roadless
[03:29.77] We were singing at the top of our lungs to the numbness
[03:33.09] This city never died
[03:35.31] I'll say goodbye to the soul inside
[03:36.85] And yet somehow
[03:38.04] There was romance
[03:39.20] In our self-hate
[03:40.56] We've got no chance
[03:41.71] In this light maze
[03:43.12] But let's hold hands
[03:44.66] Through the night haze
[03:46.06] We'll run so fast
[03:47.30] 'Til the school chime
[03:48.67] 'Til the train runs
[03:49.99] We know it's time
[03:51.27] We're the sane ones
[03:52.68] Waking up now
[03:54.00] To the real life
[03:55.32] Let me daydream
[03:56.60] 'Til the next night
[03:57.84] I'll keep waiting
[04:06.34] 
[04:01.94] I'll keep waiting for you
[04:14.44] 
[04:30.03] Waking up now, to my real life
[04:32.59] Let me daydream 'til the next flight
[04:35.24] Drowning so long, I got older
[04:37.84] Now the crowd's gone, is it over?
[04:40.65] Is it over?
