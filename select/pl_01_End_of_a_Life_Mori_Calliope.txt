We'd run
Right through
Those nights
I'll never find my way back
to you, inside this labyrinth
of lights
There was madness
In the meaning
Never laughless
We were screaming at the top
of our lungs to the numbness
This city never died
I'll fly
No proof
Those heights
I'll never find another chance
to say "hey thanks
for saving my life"
I was hopeless
It was stinging
Running roadless
We were singing at the top
of our lungs to the numbness
This city never died
What was the root of it all?
I couldn't say.
Used to jump and then fall
Rugged and cliched
Would shrug it off
without complaint, not a sound
No use in trying
to find friends,
cuz in the end nobody
sticks around
Its when you shoved yourself
into a crowded place
That you turned around
and found yourself in love
in outer space
Cue the reckless nights,
no strings,
Laughing at our own dreams
Just what the hell was so funny?
Bark up the wrong tree, stumble,
used to falling great heights
Amidst a concrete jungle,
singing cuz it felt right
We mixed the ennui
and troubles rhyming
our discontent
And though it's history,
I can't forget the time
that we spent
Convinced that this could mean
another end
Exists between real
and pretend
A twisted alter-fiction
where I missed my chance,
did not ascend and
Disappearing into the mist
of "never happened"
Is the me that I can
never befriend.
I let it go…
Fade in, fade out
This crazy dream
Without a direction,
floating aimlessly
There's nothing left back
there for me
Breathe in, but it won't stop
the rain from pouring
We'd run
Right through
Those nights
I'll never find my way back
to you inside this labyrinth
of lights
There was madness
In the meaning
Never laughless
We were screaming at the top
of our lungs to the numbness
This city never died
But was there ever
a soul inside?
Chasing fireflies
Between the soaring high-rises
Left a trail behind
defined it "wasted time
of our lives"
Silent singer, overworked
and underpaid
Thinks an office is a coffin
until off is where you're laid
Yet a thought persists,
an optimist who ought
to be afraid
Saw the "nothing wrong"
in writing songs behind
the lonely shade
Is the world a sadder place
without the words
that you conveyed?
When the ladder fell
and shattered every bar that
we had played
Does it matter in the end
the sound diminished and decayed
And your friends grew tired
of fantasy? You're wishing
they had stayed?
You don't get to say
"I miss you"
You watched your heroes fade
Into the rear view-mirror
of the villain you portrayed
Stop the pity party, listen,
you don't get to be dismayed
You don't get to be emotional,
feel blessed you got it made
These the best of years of life
because you chose
to make a trade
Recollect the days you hoped
and you prayed for this
What is there to miss?
Fade in, fade out
This hazy dream
Without a direction,
roaming aimlessly
There's nothing left back
there for me
Pretend it's the end
of a made up story
I'll fly
No proof
Those heights
I'll never find another chance
to say
"hey thanks for saving my life"
I was hopeless
It was stinging
Driving roadless
We were singing at the top
of our lungs to the numbness
This city never died
I'll say goodbye
to the soul inside
And yet somehow,
There was romance
In our self-hate
"We've got no chance"
In this light maze
But let's hold hands
Through the night haze
We'll run so fast
'Til the school chime
'Til the train runs
We know it's time
We're the sane ones
Waking up now
To the real life
Lemme daydream
'Til the next night
I'll keep waiting
I'll keep waiting for you
Waking up now
To my real life
Lemme daydream
'Til the next flight
Drowning so long
I got older
Now the crowd's gone
Is it over?
Is it over?
